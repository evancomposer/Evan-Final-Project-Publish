    <p>Canadian-American composer Evan Johnson (b. 1998) strives to create music that explores the concept of narrative, applying music to his loves of literature, drama, and film. Equally at home in large concert halls and intimate studio environments, his catalogue includes music for large orchestra, choirs of varying sizes, mixed chamber ensembles, solo instruments, and electronics. Stylistically diverse, his works have explored minimalism, pop, spectralism, jazz, serialism, and microtonality. Evan is particularly active in the worlds of musical theatre and film scoring, always seeking meaningful collaborations with other artists. His music has been performed by groups such as The Walden School Players, Apple Hill Chamber Ensemble, and the Contemporary Music Ensemble at Oberlin Conservatory. Evan received his first professional commission at age 12. His full-length musical, <em>We Are Here</em>, co-written with his creative partner Socks Whitmore, will premiere at CalArts on February 2nd, 2019. His choral work <em>The Einstein Complex</em> will be premiered by the CalArts Contemporary Vocal Ensemble in May. Evan spent six summers at The Walden School, a renowned composition program for young musicians in Dublin, New Hampshire where he studied with distinguished composers such as Sky Macklay, Osnat Netzer, and Sam Pluta. He is currently studying with Marc Lowenstein at The Herb Alpert School of Music at The California Institute of the Arts.
